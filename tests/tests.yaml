# A test is structured as follows:
# `from` is the original list of tasks
# `to` is the modified list of tasks
# `new` is the expected list of tasks detected as new
# `changes` is a list of TaskDelta<Vec<String>> that describes the expected detected
#     changes. For each entry in `from`, a corresponding entry in `changes`
#     will contain an object describing the computed changes.
# Here is an example:
